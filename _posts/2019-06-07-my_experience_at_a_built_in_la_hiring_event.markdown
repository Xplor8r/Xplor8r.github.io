**Built In** is a revolutionary online recruitment platform founded in Chicago in **2011**. Today they serve seven US tech communities including **Austin**, **Boston**, **Chicago**, **Colorado**, **NYC**, **Seattle** and **LA** with plans to expand to other tech hubs soon. Their location focused content online and in-person events give local tech professionals insights into hiring companies.

Last night I attended a **Built in LA hiring event**, where I made several connections, spoke with a few recruiters at very impressive companies, handed out 4 resumes, and enjoyed one free beer and hor derves.

As I entered the event venue, I was instructed to fill out a name tag and use color coded stickers to indicate my specialty/industry. It seemed that the name tags were more of an ice-breaker for mingling job hunters to connect than for the recruiters. However, I wanted to stand out and be memorable, so I wrote *"Mikey P."* instead of Michael(or *"Old"*, or *"Lame"*). I chose red for design and blue for tech. I figured, as a Front-End/Full-Stack Developer with a background in Graphic Design combining these two would suffice.

I came away from last night with a great respect for the attending recruiters. To withstand 2 straight hours of back to back mini interviews with potential hires is an impressive undertaking. Fortunately, I decided to meet first with a recruiter of the company I connected with most. I believe it to be the highest potential for converting to the next step. I am super excited about the opportunity to be a part of their mission.

Regardless of the outcome, I know that making the 60-mile roundtrip through traffic was well worth the experience and I will definitely be attending the next event, if I don't get hired by one of the companies, that is.
