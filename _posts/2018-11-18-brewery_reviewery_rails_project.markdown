Visit your Local Brewery or visit a Brewery thats new to you. Eat some grub, sip some craft brew, then share a review using the new app Brewery Reviewery. Brewery Reviewer is a Ruby on Rails forum app for posting reviews for breweries across the U.S. Users must sign up or log in in order to contribute.

I'm writing this blog late night after putting in about 14 hours straight. In my current mental state, I can't quite be sure if my project is 100% complete but I do have a blog deadline to meet. I once again have been consumed by this passion to create, to learn, and to overcome challenges. This online program has allowed me to tap into an amazing ability to self motivate.

My passion for tasty craft brewery ales guided me through this project. I've been very interested working with comment threads and filtered lists as well and I was able to apply them both my app. I challenged myself whenever I could as well to implement rails helper methods to be able to learn more than what was included in the rails curriculum. With Omniauth I chose to use google as an alternate log in method.

In the end I feel confident that my skills working with Ruby on Rails will be a great asset in my transition into a new career as a developer. I have gone through so many peaks and valleys during the school over the last few months. I am so ready to hit that 3/4 mark for the program and start rocking the Javascript!
