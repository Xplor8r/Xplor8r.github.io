Since I officially started my job search after graduating from Flatiron's Full Stack Web Development online boot camp I have been focused alot on networking. Meetups are an essential part of networking for budding web developers and a great way to learn, teach, share and maybe even GET HIRED! In the past two weeks I have been to five tech meetups in three different cities all having some level of focus towards computer programming. I'd like to share some ideas and tips on how best to approach attending a tech meetup in the hopes of landing that first tech job.
### Listen and Be Helpful

Instead of just focusing on your 30 second elevator pitch or showing off your projects make an effort to listen carefully to what other people are working with and how you might be able to help. If you connect someone looking for a different position with someone else, that has that exact need, then you can build a reputation for being helpful and cooperative. This will build you alot of karma points that will pay you back in the long run.
### Quality not Quantity

It's easy to think that passing out resumes to everyone or asking everyone to connect with you on LinkedIn is the only way to network. Try getting to know a few like minded individuals who are maybe at your level or even working for a company that you want to work for. Making a good connection and participating in meaningful, relevant conversations is way more important than spreading yourself all over the room handing out business cards.
### Be Direct

Let's say you're in your best suit, you're fully prepared and you've just met a recruiter. They are looking to hire, and you feel like you might be the perfect fit for the position. Be clear and tell them exactly what you are looking for. Are you looking for a roll as front-end developer, back-end developer, full-stack developer or software engineer? Do you want to work full time, part time, as an intern or remotely? Maybe they won't have any immediate openings for you but later down the line they could connect with someone looking to fill that exact position that you are looking for and will give you a call.

Preparing yourself for a tech meetup might feel like Jack Burton felt while descending through underground caverns and into the headquarters of the evil Lo Pan(Do yourself a favor a rent Big Trouble in Little China.). However, you can rest assured that if you follow these tips you will have a set of tools that will aid you in the networking process during your job search. Remember to always be helpful, patient, and honest and make meaningful connections when attending tech meetups.
