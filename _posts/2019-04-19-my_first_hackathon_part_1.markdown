Tomorrow I will return to my alma matter **California State University Long Beach** to participate in [Beach Hacks](https://www.beachhacks.com/), my first **Hackathon**. I am so excited and because I've heard so many positive things about Hackathons. Regardless of the fact that I will be twice the age of most of the other participants I am extremely honored to be accepted and eager to learn from the experiences.

Twenty years ago I was accepted as a **Graphic Design** major into **CSULB**. I later changed majors and eventually graduated with a **Bachelor of Arts** degree in **Anthropological Photography**. It's been a long journey since then. I find myself here, in front of the computer feeling like I've booked a ticket on a time machine. That younger version of me I hold so close.

The internet was simply in adolescence when I first discovered her. I can remember browsing the web with **Netscape** after hearing the sweet music of a dial-up modem. As my world expanded during college I felt the need to pursue other interests, to travel the world, to have life changing experience.

All the learning I've done in the past year has allowed me to tap into that creativity and problem solving skills that I developed during my early college career. Building my first web-facing app using Sinatra reminded me so much of that first website I built using the first version of **Macromedia Flash**.

Today, I have reignited that passion for web design and web development. Technology is right where I dreamed it would eventually be. I'm taking part in every chance I get to explore the ever evolving tech industry. I hope to learn, teach, create, build, and have a blast this weekend.
