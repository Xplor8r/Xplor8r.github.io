As I continue the pursuit for the most ideal **Tech Career** path I have been unable to narrow down to just one or even a few *'dream Job'* scenarios. It seems each week another opportunity that excites me comes in and out with the tide. I am currently focusing on finding my place in a **Startup** that I strongly believe in. I've attempted to weigh out all of the **good** and the **bad**(and the **ugly**) aspects of working for a start up.

* **Startups hire you based not only on your skills, but your ability to work beyond your specific job requirements.** This is a great opportunity to learn and grow your skills. You could be involved in a multitude of technical and non-technical areas.
* **Remote work is possible.** Alot of the time when it's early in the game Startups make every attempt at reducing overhead costs. Office space is a huge part of that and so working from home is sometimes welcomed. 
* **You and the founders can collaborate directly with each other without midlevel supervision.** This is a smoother process for work to get done more effectively.
* **There is more freedom to express your creative opinions directly to decision makers in the company.** Working in a such tight-knit company also allows you to be more prideful in the growth of the company. When this happens, it's much easier to feel satisfaction in the work you have contributed.
* **Startup CEOs will usually offer you equity.** As the company becomes worth more, so do you.

* **With a smaller group comes more work.** Working long hours may be neccesary in order to quickly grow the business. Being overworked and overstressed could cause a serious decline in job satisfaction.
* **Sometime founders of a startup have a breakthrough concept, significant seed funding but have zero leadership abilities.** It can be difficult to work for someone that lacks direction and makes poor decisions.
* **Salary is less than working for a large Corporation.** It is possible Startups will invest alot in you based on frivolous spending. Most likely, it's the other way around, and you will be offered less than the average wage for your position.

* **Startup can't promise any stability.** Even if you love your job, statistics show that you won't be employed for long. Most startups don't last passed a few years.
* **If the Startup does continue after those first few years there is usually a struggle to survive.** As the competion, the economy and the world of technology evolves it's an ongoing battle to stay prevalent in the industry.

With all the risks involved, I feel the startup environment is where I see myself fitting in best at this point in my career. I enjoy every opportunity to be challenged. I want to be directly involved in all I can to advance the success of a company. If I can get in on the ground floor and witness the birth, growth, and success of an idea I strongly believe in then I have succeeded in finding that *'dream job'*.
