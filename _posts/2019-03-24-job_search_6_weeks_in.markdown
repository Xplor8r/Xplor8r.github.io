I am struggling to find a topic to cover in this weeks blog post. As I approach the end of my sixth week of job searching, I figure it might be interesting to look at how things have been for me over the past month and a half. I hope this will give perspective to other students and graduates. Let's take a look at some of my stats.
### **Job applications sent - 58**
### **Official job rejections- 15**
### **Meetups attended - 12**
### **Connections made via networking outreach - 79**
### **Git commits - 112**
### **Blog posts - 6**
### **Career coach meetings - 6**

It hasn't been easy keeping up the motivation. I regularly feel like I could and should be doing more. I am fortunate enough to have a very supportive wife. I constantly receive positive feedback from the network I have been building as well. It's always good to look back at how far I've come for inspiration.
