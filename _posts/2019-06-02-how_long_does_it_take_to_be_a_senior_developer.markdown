After more than three months of sifting through and applying to job openings on **LinkedIn**, **Angellist**, **Glassdoor**, **Indeed**, and **Resume Library** I have made a valuable discovery. There is no tech industry regulated standard for *"Junior"*, *"Mid"*, and *"Senior"* level titles. Apparently, each company has the power to use these titles as they see fit. I began a discussion about this last week by posting on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6539871894252908544), which revealed it to be a very interesting and controversial topic.

A few recruiters and hiring managers were able to give their feedback and shed some light on the subject. Among their client companies there's a huge range of expectations behind the Senior Developer role. Some roles are considered *"Senior"* after **10 years** of experience while others want only **3 years**. Titles are usually inflated. Company could be doing this simply to offer lower wages when prospective employees don't reach their high standards.

Some experienced Developers and Engineers were also able to give input to the conversation. The years of experience seem to be weighted based on a variety of different responsibilities involved when employed as a Developer. These are some questions that help decipher how much potential your years of work experience validate a Senior role:

* **Are you coding from scratch or are you maintaining existing code?**
* **What level of quality is the work that you have completed?**
* **Do you build complete projects independently?**
* **Have you lead a few or a even a large group of other developers on projects?**
* **Did you work at several companies or in the same place?**

I personally don't support the usage of Junior vs Senior job titles, yet I recognize their prominence in the tech industry. 
I have heard several success stories where entry level Devs have been placed in Senior level positions with 6 figure salaries. Competency plays a big part in your worth to an employer, and I strive to improve my skills constantly to be able to contribute as much as possible to my next employer. I believe that a clear career path to advance within an organization is more valuable then playing the waiting game for that *"Senior"* job.
