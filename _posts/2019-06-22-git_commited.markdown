**BE CRAZY FOR CODE!**

As a **Flatiron** grad still looking to break into a career as a web developer, I have received this advice(translated into my own words) several times. It's not easy to sustain momentum programming after graduating with a **CS Degree** or a **Coding Bootcamp**. However, technical recruiters want to see that you are passionate about code and **GitHub** is a perfect avenue to display your efforts publicly.

(I wish I was this committed)

I am continuing to commit code as I build new **apps**, practice **algorithm challenges** and contribute to **open source projects**. As I learn new **frameworks**, **libraries** and **languages** I plan to share my skills via GitHub as well. **Weekly**, I am pushing as many lines of code as possible to my profile and have manicured it to be a significant extension of my resume.

I have seen some cases where grads drop off the radar and don't continue pushing code. Even after accepting that first, second, or even third job offer it's necessary to continuing to work on personal projects and pushing it to your profile.

**I AM CRAZY FOR CODE!**

The creativity and problem solving skills required for any position as a web developer is what I thrive on most. I am committed to this career change and to my future. Out of all that is required to reach my goals, coding is the easiest to maintain.
