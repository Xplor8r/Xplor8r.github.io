A **content management system** or **CMS** is software that manages the creation and adjustment of the content on a website. **No coding is required**. A front-end user interface gives the user access to the modification and deletion of content from a website. In the back-end the new information is compiled, and the website is updated.

The most popular CMS currently is **WordPress**, which is used by roughly **30%** of all websites on the internet. There is a list of other content management systems used as well, including **Drupal** and **Joomla**. The content management system developer job market is huge. A recent figure was set at **1,652,185,816 websites** built using a CMS according to [netcraft.com](https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2018/11/26/november-2018-web-server-survey.html "netcraft.com").

I decide to give myself a few days to tinker around with WordPress to get a taste of how it works and to build a **portfolio** site in the process. To start off I stuck with the free plan at [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/ "wordpress.com") and was very pleased with the ease of use. It was a bit weird though, going from building apps with **Ruby on Rails** and **React.js** to using WordPress and having minimal access to **HTML** and **CSS** code.

I was able to upgrade to a **Personal** plan which freed up more room to play around. It allowed me to remove ads from my project and to create my own domain name. If I were to go for the **Premium** plan I could have more control over my content as well as the theme design of my webpages. There are several plugin tools that a Premium or **Business** plan holder can also install for creating an **ECommerce** site, managing **SEO**, building up **Cybersecurity**, etc. 

I currently have my portfolio site live at [michaelpieschel.com](https://michaelpieschel.com/ "michaelpieschel.com"). Please feel free to visit. Also give a look into content management systems and see if they could be a good fit for your next project.
