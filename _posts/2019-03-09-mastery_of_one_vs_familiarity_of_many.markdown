Over the past month, my pursuit for advancement in a career in web development has been filled with a trove of different forms of advice. A number of senior developers and engineers that work in a variety of fields, from data science to UX/UI Design, have kindly passed on a wide range of insight to assist me in my journey. There seems to be two very different mindsets on the best way to advance my technical skillset in order to be hirable in the tech industry.

On one hand, I have received a perspective that is non-specific and involves having a wide range of knowledge and experience. Be it with Rails, React, Ruby, JavaScript, Angular, Node, Python, SQL, etc. becoming reasonably acquainted with several programming tools could be the best way into the field of web development.

The alternative advice is to master one particular skill and go deep into learning everything there is to know about a particular framework, language or library. At this point, with my eagerness to learn more JavaScript and front end development, it seems as though React.js would be an ideal choice for me. Keeping all my efforts in one direction might make it easier to become expert React developer.

Does this mean, though, that I should never touch Angular.js or Vue.js?

Is having more incite into back end development useless?

Should I not even bother to understand how data collected from the user is sorted with algorithms by data science engineers?

What if a framework or a language that hasn't been invented yet becomes the newest, most popular thing and I let it pass me by because I've got blinders on?

These are all valid concerns I have trouble with trying to settle on a skill to put my full focus on. For now it seems like I'll make a compromise. I plan to keep working with both Ruby on Rails and React.js together to rebuild my sinatra portfolio project called Surfers Log. I hope to make Surfers Log version 2.0 a passion project that will further my skills with both skills. At the very least I can enjoy revisiting the connection of two of my passions in surfing and web development.
