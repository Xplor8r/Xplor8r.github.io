Just twenty minutes ago I completed my first two online multiple-choice skills assessment tests. They covered the subjects of Ruby on Rails and React. I can only say that I might not ever see the results but have a very mixed outlook on what they might look like.

I successfully completed a first phone screen last week with a technical recruiter at a hiring agency for a remote Ruby on Rails and React developer position. My dream job!

There was a catch. They were searching for an intermediate to senior level developer. Recently, I have been receiving alot of advice and encouragement from acquaintances to delicately exaggerate my skill level, of course within reason and at the most opportune moments.

It seemed that the recruiter had selected me after seeing my LinkedIn profile, my Github profile, and my post boot camp tailored resume and thought I would be a great fit. I went along with it and gave them the impression that my skills were strongly above average in both Rails and React.

They might very well have just said, "Prove it!". Instead, I was subsequently requested to take two very difficult assessment test through a third-party provider over the weekend at home. The results would be forwarded to the recruiter and the hiring manager at the client company with the opening.

I can only guess what that email will display.

There are a few take aways from this experience and I'm sure more to come. Bending the truth on a resume or in an interview should be done with great care. Especially, when discussing skillsets and level of competency. However, I do feel that had I down played my knowledge of Rails and React I might not have had an opportunity to have my first experience professional level technical skills tests. 

...and who knows, it's still possible I could get the job!
