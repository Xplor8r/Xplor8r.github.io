For every aspiring web developer, one of the greatest pleasures(*I assume, not from personal experience.*) is to see your freshly built app live on the web.

Unfortunately, I have decided that I will be halting my attempts to deploy my three core projects using the cloud platform **Heroku** for a portfolio site. After spending days worth of committing my efforts and sifting through numerous documentation, errors and warnings I've reached a point where I simply need to direct my attention elsewhere. I long to learn more by creating, to extend my skillset, to be hirable and not to continue down a road of frustration.

Having a portfolio site is something every job seeking developer should have. Luckily, **Flatiron School** cohorts are given the opportunity to create and maintain a **Github** profile site where your code can be displayed openly. `README` files allow a user to give full description, installation instructions, and images or videos of each project. With the ability to display all your activity and up to six pinned repositories Github will "walk the walk" as a portfolio site in my opinion.

Dedicating myself to only a handful of goals outside of the job search has been difficult. I believe that continuing to learn is very important so I have been self-teaching myself **Angular** as well as furthering my understanding of the **JavaScript** language by tackling algorithm challenges on **Codewars**. Maintaining my skills in **Ruby on Rails** and **React** is also a necessity. I am currently building my passion project with a Rails **back-end** and React **front-end**.

As I move away from my difficult experiences with Heroku, I will be keeping an open mind about exploring other venues of deploying my app to the web. For now I'm sticking with my gut. Focusing on learning Angular, deepening my JavaScript knowledge, building a passion project with Rails and React as well as maintaining a well manicured Github profile will be plenty to keep myself busy in between seeking employment.
