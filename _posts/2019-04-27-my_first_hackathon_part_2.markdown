I had such a fantastic experience last weekend participating in the **Beach Hacks** hackathon at my alma mater **California State University Long Beach**. I was twice the age of the majority of the other hackers but was blown away by the talent in the room. The event was held in the same room I saw the **Black Eyed Peas** perform live before they released their first album in *1998!*

The competition was tough with over sixty submissions and teams coming from as far away as Florida. My hackathon team **PuppyGoggles.com** was fortunate enough to win best registered domain name! Though we were unable to complete our project, we received tons of recognition for our idea!

My two teammates are currently enrolled as **Computer Science** majors at **CSULB**. They have developed a solid **data science** foundation working with in language **Java** through there studies, however, they hadn't worked yet with any libraries or frameworks. As a **Bootcamp** grad with more technical, application building abilities, I was able to build a **React** front-end for the project. We all came to learn and be challenged and just before beginning our project we attended a workshop covering all the current **Google Cloud Platform** tools for developers for inspiration.

During the Google workshop we spawned an idea while learning about the [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/). After an image is uploaded to the API, a list of data referencing the image is returned. When a dog photo is uploaded, the data returned include a list of specific breed predictions along with a confidence percentage for each.

Our team attempted to set up a database of images of dogs with their corresponding data using the [Google Cloud  Firestore API](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/reference/rest/) . The goal was to crawl animal shelter website for photos as well as set up a user interface to allow users to upload images of found dogs. Then a user who came to our site when their dog was lost could upload images of their dog, the date and location their dog went missing, and be able to view a list of potential matches. 

I will never forget attending my first hackathon. I learned so much and made many meaningful connections. I do also strongly believe that our project has the potential to solve a real problem. It could be a great innovation in helping connect lost puppies to their owners!
