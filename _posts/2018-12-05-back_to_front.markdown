As I have transitioned from the back-end to the front-end section of the online Full stack Web Development Program here at Flatiron I have been faced with a few obstacles. I was under the assumption that finishing the Rails project would lead into a downhill slope of learning JavaScript and the front-end focused part of Web development. It seems as though the intensively immersed schedule I have maintained caused me to feel a bit of programming burnout.

Since taking a few days off for Thanksgiving I have felt like my pace has been that of a sloth crawling through the mud. Trying to convince myself that I am not getting too burnt out has become harder as each failed attempt to put in solid days worth of studying and coding passes. The rails project required over a weeks worth of 8 to 14 hour days. Because of this I felt it necessary to compromise my overall goals a bit to ease some of the self-induced pressure to graduate this year.

A strong working knowledge of JavaScript, for me, is the golden ticket, and I see a career in front-end web development as the Wonka Factory. I can only surmise that my recent lack of motivation is only a brief hiccup and that I will regain focus inorder to absorb as much of the core concepts of JavaScript presented in the school as possible. I strongly believe that my journey toward the end goal will be a wonderful adventure that hopefully will consist of a psychedelic boat ride with my new employer at the helm.
