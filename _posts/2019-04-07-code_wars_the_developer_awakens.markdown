Solving coding challenges(Without the blast shield down) is a perfect opportunity for junior developers to improve their programming skills. There are several websites devoted to this theme, including the very popular **Codewars**. Codewars is an online environment for all computer programmers to train, grow and share their coding abilities. After creating an account, members instantly have access to wide variety of different types of challenges and puzzles. 

## Katas

**Kata** is a Japanese word for a system of individual training exercises for practitioners of karate and other martial arts. At [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/) katas are unique coding exercises that train an array of skills in a wide range of programming languages. They can help you become a better problem solver, learn new algorithms, prepare for job interviews and learn the intricacies of a specific programming language.

Each kata has a difficulty rating or rank assigned to it. Each member has there own rank as well and by completing higher ranked kata, you advance to higher ranks. Relevant challenges are recommended to the user based on their rank.

After solving each kata you can unlock every other solution completed by other users. This allows you to compare your solution with others in order to better understand best practices. A discussion forum is included for each kata allowing a open conversation about different approaches and techniques. Codewars community members can even create new katas to challenge fellow programmers.

Regardless of if you are using codewars.com or any of the other coding challenge website it's a great way to continue growing as a developer. I recommend checking out their site if you haven't already. Below I included a link to my profile.
