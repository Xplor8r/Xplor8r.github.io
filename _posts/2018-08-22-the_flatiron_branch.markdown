My life up to this point is simply a GitHub repository with multiple branches. I am now building one of the most significant branches since the master branch of my childhood. This current branch is called the Flatiron branch. It will undoubtedly contain many bugs along the way. I chose to build this branch in order to fulfill my desire to learn, to create, and to explore.

Learning is a life long experience. A career in web development requires absorbing a constant stream of new information, coding languages, and techniques. Prior to starting my learning path with Flatiron School I lacked the resources to be cognitively challenged. I now feel extremely confident that this new career path allows me to reach a higher level of knowledge.

The ability to create is a skill we are all born with. The previous path I was on for years included zero ability to express my creativity. I feel that software and web development are both artforms in themselves. Tapping into that natural creative human ability is a goal I can achieve through Flatiron School. I am excited most about this factor of my new path.

Life is a series of challenges that builds who we are. Diving into the unknown and into a new career is an extremely daunting concept. It will be one of the most adventurous things I've ever done. Where will it take me? Only time will tell.
 
I am very excited about the prospect of reaching all of my life goals. I strongly believe that the Flatiron Online Full Stack Web Development program is a perfect kick starter for my journey. I see my future self proudly merging all the branches of my life into an extensive array of adventure, knowledge, and creation.
