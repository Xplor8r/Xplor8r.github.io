About 3 years ago Flatiron School included a course for AngularJS(created by Google) in their online Learn.co curriculum. This was put aside in order to incorporate ReactJS(created by Facebook) which is what is taught currently in the Full Stack Curriculum. These two front end frameworks have a very similar popularity growth over the past 5 years.

After graduating from Flatiron's Full Stack Curriculum in January, I had access to the previously included AngularJS section. I strongly feel that AngularJS is still a very viable skill for a Front End developer. I decide that I would complete the course and was able finish this past week.

AngularJS version 1.7 was released in June 2018 and support will be offered until June 2021. No more version releases will come after that. For that reason I do see a potential for interest in the framework to fade. This would leave AngularJS developers with the decision of migrating their projects to Angular(2+), Vue, ReactJS or another front end app framework.

I plan on building a simple app and connecting it to a basic Ruby on Rails API using AngularJS. After completing it, I plan to migrate the project into a ReactJS front end and connecting to the same Rails back end. I believe that the ability to migrate or translate code from one framework to another is a very viable skill.

When working with an extremely large project, I can see it being a difficult and arduous task that not many developers care to undertake. As for myself, I welcome the challenge! I will be writing of my experience in a future blog post. Stay tuned!
