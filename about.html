<p>My first exposure to web development was in college during the late 90's. I was a graphic design student using early various, early version, software, such as Photoshop and Illustrator. I designed web pages using the first version of Flash and Dreamweaver. The internet was simply in adolescence when I first discovered her. I can remember browsing the web with Netscape after hearing the sweet music of a dial-up modem.</p>

<p>I struggled to continue my graphic design degree loosing my focus with such archaic processing speeds. At some point I became very much interested in travel, culture, and photography and changed major to a BA in Anthropological Photography. This would build the path that lead me to travel Central America. Eventually, I would join the Peace Corps and serve as a volunteer in El Salvador.</p>

<p>Upon returning to the states from Peace Corps work I found my way into another government position with the United States Postal Service. My career with the Postal Service has allowed me to see and experience living in various California locations. With the benefit of transfer opportunities, I have worked and lived in the Redwood forests of the North, the farming communities of the Central Coast and the suburban beach communities of So Cal.</p>

<p>Today, a fire burns within me. I have a deep desire for a life filed with adventure, exploration and mind expanding experiences. I have rekindled a passion for the world of knowledge that hides just behind these digital screens we all have grown to love. I have excepted them not only as tools for sociological advancement but as sources of income as well.</p>

<p>Through the Full Stack Web Development curriculum at Flatiron school, I've been able to pivot and turn toward a brighter future as a professional web developer. This blog is meant to share my experiences, explorations, and learning along the way. Enjoy!</p>
